&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Gretchen E. Hansen, 100, of Baraboo, passed away on Thursday,
Feb. 1, 2018 at St. Clare Meadows Care Center. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Gretchen was born at home in St. Charles, Iowa, (Madison
County) on Dec. 9, 1917 to E.E. and Adah Mae (Quiggin) Murphy. In 1919, she
moved with her family to a farm near Wyeville in the Tomah area and later moved
into Tomah where she graduated from Tomah High School in 1934. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;She worked several part-time jobs in the area and in 1938 married
Donald L. Hansen. Don worked for the Milwaukee Road and his job moved them to
live in Wausau, where their son, Dan was born. In 1946, the family moved to
Tomahawk and then to Wabasha, Minnesota in 1955. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Gretchen worked as a secretary for various employers and was
active in the local Eastern Star organization, church, card clubs, bowling
leagues and square-dancing. After Don’s death in 1981, Gretchen moved to
Baraboo in 1991 to be near Dan and Lynne with their family. She made many new
friends and was active in her membership at First Presbyterian Church of
Baraboo, Eastern Star and various other groups until failing health required
her to move to St. Clare Meadows. On Dec. 9, 2017, her immediate family
gathered to celebrate Gretchen’s 100&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; birthday. What a memorable
event! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Survivors include her son and daughter-in-law, Dan (Lynne) Hansen;

in death by 13 siblings and their spouses, and other relatives and friends. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;A private family graveside service will take place at a later
date. The family would like to express their gratitude to Dr. Ethan Carlson and
the caregivers at St. Clare Meadows for the care and attention given to
Gretchen during her stay. She appreciated the staff and the “good food” very
much. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East St., Baraboo, is

Ford, North Carolina - Dr. Ronald Stephen Ostrowski, 78, of Sherrills Ford, NC,

was born on March 3, 1939 in Chicago, IL, to the late Stephen and Julia
Salinski Ostrowski. Ron grew up in Chicago’s South Side and graduated from De
La Salle High School. He was a proud veteran of the U.S. Navy. After service to
his country, he received his B.S. and M.S. degrees from Northern Illinois
University and his Ph.D. from the University of Notre Dame.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He worked as a Professor of Biology
specializing in Genetics at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte for
34 years, retiring in 2005. During that time, he mentored many students in
biology and pre-med.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;He also had many other
professional activities that included serving on the Planned Parenthood Board
of Directors, consulting for the Association for Sickle Cell Disease, and
collaborating with the Clinical Genetics Program at Carolinas Medical Center.
Since 1992 he enjoyed working as a DNA consultant and expert witness in the
court system. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

enjoyed gardening, remodeling and home projects, ballroom dancing, classic old
movies and fifties music (especially Doo Wop) – he would sing along to every
song. He was a wonderful teller of stories – and oh the stories he told! (He
had many adventures in his life!) He had a strong love and loyalty to his
family and his many, many dear friends. He will be greatly missed.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;calibri&amp;quot;;"&gt;Wisconsin Dells - Wayne W. Wolter of
rural Wisconsin Dells graduated to his Saviour's presence on Nov. 20, 2017
following a stay at the Hospice House in Baraboo.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;calibri&amp;quot;;"&gt;Wayne was born on March 28, 1938 as the
second of three sons to Raymond and Edna (Paepke) Wolter on the same farm south
of Reedsburg where his father and grandfather were born. Wayne grew up in
Baraboo and graduated from Baraboo High School in 1956.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;calibri&amp;quot;;"&gt;Wayne married Geraldine Ann Krenz of
Lake Delton on October 3, 1959. They were blessed with four children. Wayne
worked as a meat cutter, motel operator, carpenter, and fireman at the Badger
powder plant. He finished his working career with 30 years of service at UPS as
a package and semi driver.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;calibri&amp;quot;;"&gt;After purchasing 80 acres of land four
miles west of Lake Delton, Wayne built a large home for his family. While
driving nights to Minneapolis and back for UPS, Wayne cut trees on the property
which were milled into lumber for the house. All of the cement work was mixed
on site and with the help of his father, father-in-law and other family members
a house was built in which he lived with his family for 45 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;calibri&amp;quot;;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Wayne was an avid fishermen and fisher
of men for God's Kingdom. He also enjoyed hunting, woodworking and was
dedicated to his family, church, and friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"&gt;Wayne
also enjoyed birds immensely and loved animals, especially his pets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;calibri&amp;quot;;"&gt;He is survived by his beloved wife of 58
years, Geraldine; and their children, Cindy (Eric) Scott, Mark (Jamie) Wolter,
Peter (Jenny) Wolter and Paul (Ann) Wolter; nine grandchildren, Courtney
(Skyler) Tacchini, Zach (Laura) Scott, Natalie (Mike) Fabretti, Meredith Scott,
Alex, Aleah, Christina, David and Jonathan Wolter; six “plate cleaner”
great-grandchildren, Vincent, Bowen and Amelia Tacchini, Susanna, Joseph and
Abigail Scott; a brother, Roger Wolter; nieces, nephews and many
"adopted" sons, daughters and brothers.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;calibri&amp;quot;;"&gt;In addition to his parents, Wayne was
preceded in death by a brother, Don.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Center. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;calibri&amp;quot;;"&gt;Joan was born on June 22, 1934, in
Joliet, Illinois, the daughter of Joseph and Josephine (Senffner) Mutz. Joan was
a graduate of Messmer High School in Milwaukee and attended Marquette University
graduating in 1956 with a degree in Medical Technology. On Nov. 17, 1956, she
was united in marriage to Edward L. Wucherer at Holy Angels Catholic Church in
Milwaukee. He preceded her in death on June 2, 2010.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Lake Amy Belle where they resided until 1967 before moving to Berlin where they
lived for over 24 years. While living in Berlin, Joan was active in several
service organizations in the community. In addition, she was a 12 year member
of the Berlin Area School District Board of Education, and participated in AFS
where she and Edward hosted three students.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

for five years, and then to Baraboo where they currently lived. While residing
in Baraboo, Joan worked as a Medical Technologist at Medical Associates-Baraboo
for over nine years and was a founding member of BASCO in September of 2001.

their small camper. She touched so many lives with her beautiful smile and her
serving heart. Dee raised her family to be strong and lean on each other; to
serve others as Jesus would and not to eat before saying grace.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

preceded in death by her husband, Robert; her son, Daniel; granddaughter,
Nicole Hause; two sisters, Helen Deutsch-Pfohl, Joyce Kennicker; one brother,
Robert Kohl; and a very special life-long friend, Nancy Gassen.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

place at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2017 at St. Joseph Catholic Church,
Baraboo, with Fr. Jay Poster officiating.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Beverly Torseth, 88, of Baraboo, formally
of Minnesota, passed away peacefully on Monday, Sept. 4, 2017, at SSM Health-St.
Clare Meadows Care Center in Baraboo.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Beverly was born on Aug. 18, 1929, to
Leslie W. Larson and Charlotte (Termath) Larson in Le Sueur, Minnesota.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Beverly and her sister, Betty Lou, were
raised by her father and step-mother, Margaret, in St. Paul, Minnesota.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Beverly graduated from Wilson High School in
1947.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She worked as a legal secretary
and married the love of her life, Thomas E. Torseth, in 1950.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;They shared 67 happy years together.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Beverly and Tom raised three children
in Roseville, Minnesota and later on a small farm in Lake Elmo. They retired in
Lakeland Shores, Minnesota and Rio Verde, Arizona before moving to Baraboo in
late 2015.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Bev was an avid reader and
bridge-player.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She had a quick wit and a
wonderful sense of humor.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She kept her
home, farm and family going while Tom worked in his silk-screen printing
business.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Her home was always open to
friends and family and she was a willing listener to all who needed to tell
their story.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;Beverly passed away three weeks after
her beloved husband, Tom.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;She is
survived by her children, Kim (Bill Conroy) Torseth of Falcon Heights and Amy
(Tim) Teelin of Baraboo; as well as her grandchildren and great grandchildren,
including Thomas N. Torseth Jr. and his daughter, Tianna; Stephanie (Timo Gee)
Torseth and their children Alex, Aren and Amari; Andi (Tony) and Jason
Krunnfusz; Joe and Erin Conroy, and extended family Antoinette (Donald) Brady
and their daughter Isabella.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Calibri;"&gt;She is preceded in death by her
husband, Thomas E. Torseth, her father, Leslie W. Larson, her mother Charlotte
(Termath) Larson, her stepmother, Maragert (Johnson) Larson; her sister, Betty
Lou (Thomas) and her son, Thomas N. Torseth, Sr.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;;"&gt;Thomas E. Torseth, 91, of Baraboo,
formally of Minnesota, passed away peacefully on Wednesday, Aug. 9, 2017, at
SSM Health-St. Clare Hospital in Baraboo.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;;"&gt;Tom was born on Aug. 5, 1926, to John and Alvilda
(Rognerud) Torseth in International Falls, Minnesota. After meeting the love of
his life on a blind date, Tom shared 67 years of wedded bliss with his bride,
Beverly. Affectionately known as “Torchy” by friends and family alike, Tom was
an innovator and an artist. After serving briefly with the US Navy, he returned
home to attend the Minneapolis School of Art and Design. He then continued to
work in the family business with Jack, his dad, until Berg-Torseth, Inc. was
sold. As a businessman, Tom was involved with the Lake Elmo Lions Club, St.
Paul 49er’s, and St. Paul Rotary Club. After 43 years of running the family
business, he retired in Lakeland Shores, Minnesota and Rio Verde, Arizona
before moving to Baraboo in late 2015.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;;"&gt;With a flair for storytelling and a knack for playful
elaboration, Tom always had a tale to tell. Among his most entertaining accounts
were memories of perfect spring days working at the farmhouse in Lake Elmo, summer
nights spent being with family at the North Shore, autumn mornings hunting in Montana,
and escaping the winter blues by golfing in Arizona. Across all of his stories
were themes of friendship, family, and a deep, understated admiration for those
around him.&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;;"&gt;Torchy was an avid reader, though his meticulously
organized collection of volumes consisted solely of grilling cookbooks, appliance
manuals, and hardware catalogues. He spent hours in his workshop “making
sawdust.” His workshop was crammed with a striking mix of power tools and
paintbrushes. The process of bringing ideas to life was perhaps what meant most
to Torchy, whether that was in art, business, or family.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;;"&gt;In many ways, Tom refused to give in to the idea of growing
old. He had a ceaseless desire to learn; he faced the transition from floppy
disk to the cloud with stubborn enthusiasm and was determined to stay ahead of the
“old man curve.” He loved as fiercely as he studied, and played as hard as he
worked. Torchy had a big personality, a big heart, and led a big and beautiful
life.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;;"&gt;Thomas is survived by his wife, Beverly; children, Kim
(Bill Conroy) Torseth of St. Paul and Amy (Tim) Teelin of Baraboo; as well as
his many grandchildren and great grandchildren, including Thomas N. Torseth Jr.
and his daughter Tianna, Stephanie (Timo Gee) Torseth and their children Alex,
Aren, and Amari, Andi (Tony) and Jason Krunnfusz, Joe and Erin Conroy; and
extended family, Antoinette (Donald) Brady and their daughter Isabella, and
Jordan Jensen. He is also survived by his siblings, John (Julie) Torseth, Delores
Hodgson, Arthur (Joanne) Torseth, and James (Cara) Torseth. Thomas was preceded
in death by his parents, John and Alvilda; his son, Thomas N. Torseth Sr.; and
mother-and father-in-law, Leslie and Margaret Larson.&lt;b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: 12pt;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: &amp;quot;times&amp;quot;;"&gt;A
Memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on Thursday, Aug. 17, 2017 at the
First Presbyterian Church, 416 Ash St., in Baraboo, with Pastor Lisa Newberry
officiating. Visitation will be at the church on Thursday from 10 a.m. until
time of service. In lieu of flowers, please donate in Torchy’s honor to Habitat
for Humanity: www.habitat.org/donate. The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East

Beverly Jane “Bev” Higgins, 64, of Baraboo, moved on to her eternal home on Friday, June 23, 2017 surrounded by her loving family after a lengthy battle with an early onset form of dementia, frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). While she took her beautiful smile with her, Bev left behind wonderful memories of the intelligent, committed, and kind person she was.
Bev was born on March 11, 1953 in Baraboo, to Lester and Betty (Decker) Wendt. She grew up with her seven siblings on a dairy farm near Merrimac. Bev attended Sauk Prairie High School, and later went on to graduate from the  University of Wisconsin–Madison 1987 class with a degree in Education. On April 6, 1974 she married the love of her life, Gene David Higgins at St. John’s Lutheran Church in Baraboo, and they had one child, Hillarie Jean Higgins.  
Passionate about community issues, Bev was actively involved with the Baraboo Literacy Council, American Association of University Women, St. Clare Hospital Auxiliary, St. Johns Ladies Aid and Flower Committee, and other volunteer groups. She served as an interim elementary educator in the Madison, Baraboo, and Wisconsin Dells school systems. In addition, Bev held her small plane pilot’s license until the time of her daughter’s birth, and later served as a Ski-Wee downhill ski instructor at Devil’s Head Resort. 
Bev loved music and the arts, and was quite proud of attending the first three years of the Madison Blues Festival, and introducing her daughter to Julian Lennon through attending an intimate performance. Her love for flowers and nature was evident in the elaborate gardens she nurtured throughout her life, and her passion for cooking was appreciated by her family and close friends.
Her imaginative mind, compassionate heart, and strong spirit brightened the world around her. She will be deeply missed, and not a day will go by without warm thoughts of her. Her family and friends look forward to seeing her again. 
Bev is survived by her loving daughter and son-in-law, Hillarie Higgins and David Mueller; three brothers, Lon and Mike Wendt, and Richard (Jan) Decker; two sisters, Barb (Ron) Dobrinska and Becky (Gary) Jenkins; brother-in-law,  James Higgins; two sister-in-laws, Nancy Higgins and Rosemary Wendt; aunt, Evelyn (Gene) Thompson; and many dear nieces, nephews, other relatives and friends.
She now goes to meet her beloved husband of 40 years, Gene Higgins; her father and mother, Lester (Betty) Wendt; her eldest brother, Larry Wendt and brother, Joe Duvall; two nephews, Cameron and Nick Wendt; father-in-law and mother-in-law, John (Dahlia) Higgins: brother-in-law and sister-in-law, Richard (Shirley) Kaestner; and her uncle-in-law, Peter Higgins.
Funeral services will be held at 12 p.m. noon on Saturday, July 8, 2017 at St. John’s Lutheran Church, Baraboo, with Pastor Nick Maglietto officiating. Visitation will be at the church on Saturday from 10 a.m. until time of service. Memorial contributions if desired may be made to the family. The Family would like to thank the staff at Agrace Hospice for the care given to Beverly. The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East St., Baraboo,&amp;nbsp;is assisting the family with arrangements.

Sharon Lee (Linde) Hillmer, 80, of Baraboo, began her eternal life on Wednesday, May 24, 2017. 
Sharon was born Oct. 22, 1936 in Madison to Dorothy Susan Harris and Carl Gjermund Linde. She graduated from Central High School in Madison and later attended the University of Wisconsin Baraboo extension. Sharon married Roger “Bud” Martin Hillmer on March 3, 1956. After Bud’s college graduation they moved back to his hometown of Baraboo. They raised their four children as well as numerous foster children and welcomed anyone as family into their home.
Sharon spent her career as a medical transcriptionist working at the University Hospital in Madison after winning a typing competition for speed and accuracy. She continued to work for the hospitals in Baraboo and local private physicians until a car accident crippled her. Sharon could often be found answering the phone at the family business, perusing her catalogs and engaging in long conversations with whomever walked in the door. 
She enjoyed couples club at church and the church choir, the Jaycettes, Baraboo Theater Guild, and the Lyle Greenwood and Fairfield Fiddlers earlier in her life. Sharon had been a part of the First Methodist Church and Walnut Hill Bible Church during her life in Baraboo. Many do not know because of her humility, but Sharon was a gifted artist, a talented violinist and had a lovely warm voice (but it was drowned out by Bud’s booming to the heavens).
Sharon worked at Renewal Unlimited helping community members rebuild lives and homes. She volunteered for two decades with Bud at Self Help Ministries where they assisted Wisconsin inmates to rehabilitate back into the community. She always looked for and believed there was good in everyone.
After her accident, Sharon ran away with the circus, luckily it was just a few blocks away and it ran away with her heart. For over 25 years she volunteered at Circus World Museum, attended circus activities and donating to circus events. She embraced the nickname “Grandma Circus” and looked forward to seeing repeat families visiting year after year.
For almost five years Sharon has resided at St. Clare Meadows where she was president of the resident council. She loved her resident neighbors and staff and will be truly missed by all who knew her.
Survivors include her son, Jon, wife Debbie; daughters, Pam Marquie, husband Tom, Susan Hillmer, Carol Keepers, husband Daniel; grandchildren, Elise Payne, husband Frank, Merrick Marquie, wife Ashton, Maureen Marquie, Linde VanSlyke and Kenny Bell; great grandchildren, Guthrie, Ivy, Violet, Vlad and Gavrila; a brother, Ken Linde, wife Denise; a sister, Jean Flansburgh, husband Roy; loving nieces and nephew as well as numerous foster children and countless friends. She was preceded in death by her husband of 46 years, Bud; and her parents Dorothy and Carl.
A Memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on Saturday, Aug. 5, 2017 at Walnut Hill Bible Church, 1900 East St., Baraboo. Visitation will be at the church from 10 a.m. until time of service with a luncheon immediately following. The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East St., Baraboo, is assisting the family with arrangements.

God’s night-time sky will shine a little brighter, as it gained another star.
Mary Helen (Piotroski) Belka, 72, of Baraboo, formerly of DeForest, passed away on Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017 at Oak Park Place with her dear husband, Frank of 53 years, by her side, as God’s will was done. Mary was born on Sept. 25, 1944 to Joseph and Rosemary (Reynolds) Piotroski of Carbondale, Indiana, later moving to Tomah. 
Mary worked for 30 years at the State of Wisconsin Department of Revenue. In her early years, she and Frank did a bit of traveling. She was a simple soul with a gift to gab and enjoyed pulling the handle at gambling casinos, casting a line, garage saling and drinking beer while playing euchre at a few of the local VFW halls. She loved brushing her cat, Tudball, spoiling her grand-dogs with stuffed toys and treats, allowing Frankie to be King of the TV remote, and of course, watching the Green Bay Packers. She enjoyed a good cheeseburger and diet pepsi, JoEllyn’s molasses ginger cookies and chocolate shakes. 
Mary was an excellent cook and made the BEST Thanksgiving stuffing. Perhaps one of her greatest joys was the feeling of making other people happy. She was a lover of much, but two things that did not go together; peanut butter and chocolate. While Mary did not attend a conventional church with four walls, she held God close to her heart. She will be truly missed by her family and friends. 
Survivors include her husband, Francis Belka of Baraboo; her beloved pride, joy, one and only son, Michael and daughter-in-law, JoEllyn (Blau) Belka of Merrimac; a brother, John Piotroski of Austin, Texas; and several nieces and nephews.
Mary is preceded in her passing by her parents; a sister, Theresa Ann; and a brother, James Piotroski of Texas. 
With respect to Mary’s wishes, a spiritual celebration of her life with a private family burial will take place at a later date.  
The family would like to give special thanks to Dr. Nathan Mustain and the staff at SSM Health St. Clare Hospital and SSM Health St. Clare Nursing Home, Home Health United Hospice and Oak Park Place for the loving care, and Fr. Jay Poster from St. Joseph Catholic Church for attending Mary’s needs in her last days before seeing her home to life eternal.
All who knew Mary were graced with her presence. May we all live our lives “in a Mary kind of way,” to forgive quickly, live simply, and love freely. A more kind and gentle soul will be hard to find. Please remember her by her gentle laugh, her “always” smile, and how she greeted you every time you came to her door. The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East St., Baraboo, is assisting the family with arrangements.

Frank Randolph Marshall III, 86, of Baraboo, joined his Lord on Saturday, Sept. 24, 2016.
Frank was born on Jan. 26, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois, to Louise (Keller) and Frank R. Marshall Jr.
At age six, Frank moved to Oshkosh to live with his uncle, George and aunt, Rhea. He was the child they never had and they became the grandparents to his children. 
As a young man, Frank spent his summers playing tennis, football and helping his uncle in the butcher shop. He attended UW Oshkosh and transferred to UW Madison and graduated in 1954 with a BS degree in Economics. While at UW Madison, he played on the varsity tennis team. In 1970, he received a MS degree from UW Whitewater to teach Special Education.  
Frank taught in the Oregon, Richland Center and Baraboo school districts at the high school level. He loved his students and saw the need for them to have breakfast, so he provided toast and peanut butter.
Frank was active in the communities where he lived and was president of the Sauk Prairie Optimist Club, member of the Baraboo Optimist Club serving on its board of directors, served three terms as Lt. Governor for the Optimist SWISS District, and raised over ten thousand dollars selling clown noses for childhood cancer research. Frank served 10 years on the Commission on Aging board of directors, drove for meals-on-wheels, and chauffeured those who needed transportation. 
Frank felt reading was the backbone of a child’s education and volunteered as a reading instructor at St. Joseph Catholic School in Baraboo, St. Aloysius in Sauk City and helped at the Kid’s Ranch. For over 35 years, Frank volunteered at nursing homes where ever he lived, and did church services at St. Clare Meadows Care Center for over 14 years with the help of his wife, Linda.
Frank loved the Lord, and was called to do His work in many ways. He belonged to numerous men’s bible studies in his life which he dearly loved. In 1996, God called on Frank to do a bible study with the inmates at the Sauk County jail. So at age 76, Frank studied to become a minister to meet the qualification to do so.
Frank was an avid sports fan of the Wisconsin Badgers and Green Bay Packers. He really looked forward to fall, as it meant the football season was approaching. Frank passed away during the Badger game and would have been very happy the won. 
Frank is survived by his first wife, Joanne Marshall (Teteak) of Florida, and their children, Paul (Michelle) of Anchorage, Alaska, and Kinberlee (Dan) McCrea of Whitewater; his second wife, Linda Marshall (Wolff) of Baraboo, and became a father to Charles (Kathryan) Listello of Greely, Colorado, and Michael Listello of Hove, England; five blessed grandchildren, Matt and Peter of Whitewater, Twyla of Greely, Colorado, and Alexandria and John of Hove, England. In addition, he leaves behind a large family of in-laws, friends and best friend and sports buddy, Frank Krom of Chicago, Illinois. He was preceded in death by his only sister, Joan; his favorite niece, Darcy; his aunt, Rhea and uncle, George; and his parents.
A celebration of Frank’s life will take place at 11 a.m. on Saturday, Oct. 8, 2016 at Walnut Hill Bible Church, 1900 East St., Baraboo, with Pastor David Hutchens officiating. Visitation will be at the church from 10 a.m. until time of service. In lieu of flowers, memorials may be given to, the reading program for children, c/o Kids Ranch, P.O. Box 219, Baraboo, or your local Optimist Club for Childhood Cancer Campaign. The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East St., Baraboo, is assisting the family with arrangements.  
Linda would like to thank all the people who supported her during Frank’s illness. She feels blessed to have her family support of Tom (Judy) Wolff and Kay Barbian of Prairie du Sac, Paul Wolff of Baraboo, Lindley Wolff of Waunakee, and her niece, Denise Earp of Merrimac, who would come running if she needed help. Also, the support from members of Walnut Hill Bible Church, Dr. Danny Sessler and the nurses and volunteers for Home Health United Hospice for whom made it possible to care for Frank at home until the day he went to see His Heavenly Father.

Rock Springs, WI. - Richard “Dick” Curtis Knight, age 81, of Rock Springs, Wisconsin passed away peacefully, surrounded by his family on Tuesday, August 2, 2016, following a long illness. Richard was born on August 31, 1934, in Rockford, IL to Roscoe and Charlotte (Williams) Knight.
Richard graduated from Rockford West High School in 1952 the same year he married Kathrine Marie Gibler, his high school sweetheart. He attended the University of Illinois, graduating in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture Economics. He began his career with Swift &amp; Company, the meat processing company, upon graduation at their headquarters in Chicago. His 31-year career with Swift included numerous positions that found him, along with his growing family, moving around the States until he was named Senior Vice President of the company in 1975, returning to Chicago. In the intervening years, he held various positions – everything from lamb buyer to plant manager to labor negotiator. 
During his years with Swift, his business travels took him around the country and abroad. He was a committee member of the American Meat Institute (AMI) in Washington, DC. In the ensuing years he did consulting work in the fresh meats industry before founding his own company, Quality Pork Processors (QPP), a pork processing company in Austin, MN in 1987. Richard remained CEO of the company until his retirement in 2000. 
Richard and Kathrine bought a farm outside of Rock Springs, Wisconsin in 1979 as a weekend retreat for themselves and their family. Working outside around the farm brought him great joy. He welcomed tending to everyday chores, especially chopping firewood, which would be used for the evening campfires and for heating the farmhouse in the early days. After the Christmas holidays, the couple relaxed at their condo in Bonita Springs, FL. Richard enjoyed boating, golf and annual fishing trips to Canada, Brazil and other locations with friends and family. He enjoyed bridge and cribbage and delighted in teaching his children and grandchildren how to play chess along with other games that required thinking skills. Movies were an important family time event for both Richard and Kathrine. He loved all kinds of music and took great pleasure in singing around the piano with family, notably Christmas carol sing-alongs during the holidays. 
He and Kathrine were doting grandparents, never missing an opportunity to attend a football game, soccer or wrestling match, swimming competitions, piano recitals or basketball games. Richard was a lifelong history buff as well as a voracious reader of historical biographies. He was fascinated with the Civil War and was proud to be a direct descendent of Frank Pettis, a Civil War drummer boy from Wisconsin who is buried in the Reedsburg Cemetery. 
Throughout his life, Richard instilled a strong work ethic, loyalty and sense of justice in both his children and grandchildren. He demonstrated these principles through his business relationships and his many charitable community endeavors where he donated his time and expertise. He gave back to the community wherever he lived. In Scottsbluff, NE he was a member of the Rotary Club and President of the Scottsbluff/Gering United Chamber of Commerce. He was condo board president at his and Kathrine’s Florida home and the first Chairman of the Plan Commission for Excelsior Township, serving from the time of its formation in 2006.
Richard and Kathrine were lifelong members of the Presbyterian Church (PCUSA), and both were active in whatever community church they joined. He served as a deacon, elder, Sunday school teacher, and in other volunteer capacities. He and Kathrine were members of both the First Presbyterian Church in Reedsburg and the First Presbyterian Church of Baraboo, where they created an Endowment Fund. His faith was a cornerstone of his life, and he took great comfort in the 23rd Psalm. He will be greatly missed.
Beloved husband of Kathrine Marie for 57 years and loving father to Sarah Elizabeth (Bill) Adamson of Naperville, IL, Martha Ann (Jeff) Hinkle of Omaha, NE, Richard Curtis, Jr. (Jim Bailey) of Chicago, IL, Julia Jean Ethun Baraboo, WI (deceased), and Susan Elaine (Tony) Carlin of Bloomfield, NJ.

His great-grandchildren are Amelia Kathrine Hinkle, Greta Martha Hinkle, Sophie Diana Hinkle, Nora Clair Hinkle, Violet Belle Hinkle, True Grace Hinkle, Calvin Knight LeBlanc, and George James Nolda. In addition, Richard is survived by his sisters Geraldine Knight of San Clemente, CA, Janet (Jim) Wisner of Wonder Lake, IL and Susan Seaver of Crystal Lake, IL, Bill and Pat Gibler, (brother and sister-in-law) of Green Valley, AZ, Joe Gibler, (brother-in-law) of Rockford, IL and Frank and Rita Gibler (brother and sister-in-law) of Rockford, IL, as well as many nieces and nephews.

Merrimac - Joseph “Joe” Raschka, 62, of Merrimac, passed away peacefully in his home surrounded by loving family on Tuesday, May 10, 2016 after a year-long struggle with cancer. 
Joe was born on June 13, 1953 in Baraboo, the son of Rudolph “Rudy” and Evelyn (Herbes) Raschka. He grew up in the town of Merrimac where he continued to live and build his own paradise out in the country.
Joe was a 1971 graduate of Sauk Prairie High School and worked at Oscar Mayer Foods Corporation for 32 years, August 1971 through November 2003. He was able to enjoy the life of retirement for 13 years. 
Even though cancer took the life of his dominant arm (left), he was determined to do what he loved. In that last year he was able to shoot a pheasant out of the air and shoot his deer with his non-dominant hand. Amazing! As many of us know, fences never stopped him.
He loved to walk and hunt the woods for Morel mushrooms, canoe the Baraboo River, wade the creeks for water crest, and best of all; go for a swim at least weekly at Devils Lake. He also enjoyed to fish and harvest his gardens.   
Merrimac was his home in which he provided entertainment to his friends through what he called the “Joe Show.”  He was unique and touched so many hearts. No matter who you were, or what background you were from, Joe was your friend. 
Joe is survived by his loving daughter, Michelle Fandrich (Bill); three courageous grandsons in which he was so proud of and will carry on some of his traditions, Dalton, Payton and Brayton Fandrich; his brothers, Francis Raschka (Debbie), Herb Raschka (Dianne); his sisters, Rosemary Wendt, Jane Coffel (Ron), Rita Collins (Tom); nephews, Derek, Dave and Michael Raschka, Ben Wendt; nieces, Lindsey and Angela Coffell, Kristi Raschka; and his ex-wife, Mary Lou Bartelt.
Joe was proceeded in death by his parents; a brother-in-law, Larry Wendt; and a nephew, Nicholas Wendt. 
A celebration of Joe’s life will take place on Saturday, June 25, 2016, from 12 noon to 7 p.m. at the Merrimac Conservation Club, Hwy 78, Merrimac. The band will begin to play at 3 p.m. Please bring a dish to pass or just yourself. The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East St., Baraboo, is assisting the family with arrangements.
The family would like to express their sincere gratitude for all the love and support from family and friends during this chapter of his life. A special thank you to the staff from Home Health for providing care and love during Joe’s last days; a big thank you to his card playing buddies that gave him something to look forward to each week; and to everyone that visited him and loved him as much as we do.
“Nature is good” and “The length of life doesn’t guarantee a better quality of life”. Joe.

Rochelle Robkin, 75, of Baraboo passed away on Tuesday, May 3, 2016 at St. Clare Hospice House in Baraboo. Rochelle was born on May 28, 1940 in Newark, N.J., the daughter of Leon and Pearl (Lombozo) Merzon.
Rochelle attended City Terrace Elementary School, Los Angeles, and continued her education at LA Community College, the University of California at Los Angeles, BA; University of Massachusetts at Amherst, MA; and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, PhD. 
Rochelle loved music and reading. She was a prolific artist and a career teacher of art to children and adults at Baraboo Elementary and Senior High School, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and U.W. Baraboo/Sauk County. 
She was active in the community and was a member of several organizations, including the International Crane Foundation, the Baraboo Optimist Club, the Baraboo Public Arts Association, the Sauk County Art Association, and Al. Ringling Theatre Friends. She was co-founder of Stage III Theater for Kids, and began the Souper Bowl program at the Baraboo High School.
Rochelle led a loving, rich and rewarding life with family, friends, colleagues and students. She can be best described as a teacher in all meanings of the word. To teach is to “pay it forward” with no expectation and no way to know what its effect will be. Rochelle dedicated her life to this, helping others to find the possibilities within them and the resources to discover and then build their own path to become what they wanted to be.
The postings now flooding onto Facebook from her students and friends tell a small part of how marvelous she was doing just that. Her light continues to blaze in all those she touched.
Rochelle is survived by her husband of 55 years, Eugene “Gene” Robkin of Baraboo; her son, David and his partner, Laura Brody of Altadena, CA.; her son, Michael Robkin and his wife, Dalia of Woodland Hills, CA.; two grandchildren, Nathaniel and Aden of Woodland Hills, CA.; her sister, Lenore Doran; and two nephews, Collin and Andrew; many cousins and countless friends. She was preceded in death by her parents, Leon and Pearl Merzon.

Everett R. Kopf, 81, of Baraboo, died on Saturday, Nov. 7, 2015 at St. Clare Meadows Care Center. While a stroke affected the last 2-1/2 years of his life, he continued to carry himself with dignity and amazing grace.
Everett was born on Feb. 3, 1934 in Ableman (Rock Springs), Wisconsin into the loving care of Raymond and Josephine (Schara) Kopf. He married the love of his life, Elaine (Retzlaff) on September 11, 1954.
He enjoyed his growing up years with three amazing siblings, LaVonne (Ray) Astle of Reedsburg, Duane (Virginia) of Baraboo and Francis (Billi) of Oregon, Wisconsin. He is preceded in death by his parents, his sister, his niece, Sandy (Astle) Marselle and his in-laws George and Irene (Pickar) Retzlaff.
He was blessed with four fun-loving children, Michael (Kathy) of Oshkosh, Randy of Baraboo, Brenda (Ron) Schultz of Baraboo, and Rebecca (Dana) Epperson of Rockford, Illinois. His children along with his wife comprised a close-knit family who were all with him until his death.  
Everett is survived by five grandchildren who adored him and couldn’t wait to spend time with him and the laughter that ensued when they all gathered: Ally (fiancé John Hodson) of Waukesha, Kari of Minneapolis, Mitchell of Denver, Robert (girlfriend Emilee Guderyon) of Madison and Josephine of Rockford. He also gained two bonus grandsons: Tyler Epperson of Tempe, Arizona and Andrew Epperson of Naperville, Illinois. His extended family also included seven nieces and nephews.
After his family, Everett’s next love was his dairy farm – the same farm he grew up on and then purchased from his own father. His caring for all of God’s living creatures, whether human or animal, all received Everett’s amazing grace and attention. Everett also was a bricklayer for several years and helped create incredible buildings and churches during the course of his work.
In addition to farming, Everett also enjoyed hunting, fishing, western movies, bowling, puzzles and traveling. His robust laughter could be heard rooms away, and his love of life and humble approach to help others before himself set him apart. He also was an active member of the Elks Club and Golden K.
Everett’s family would like to especially thank those family and friends who visited him during his time at the nursing home and made an impact throughout his life. And special recognition and love is sent to all staff members of St. Clare Care Center who made Everett’s final years respectful and loved.
A celebration of Everett’s life will be held with a visitation from 4 p.m. – 7 p.m. at St. Joseph’s Catholic Church, 300 Second Street, Baraboo, on Wednesday, November 11, 2015. Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. on Thursday, November 12, 2015 with a visitation starting at 10 a.m. Fr. Jay Poster will be officiating. Interment will take place in Pleasant Valley Cemetery in Excelsior Township. 
In lieu of flowers, the family asks that memorials be made to St. Clare Care Center Activities Department, 1414 Jefferson St, Baraboo, WI 53913 or St. Joseph’s Catholic Church Basement Project, 300 Second Street, Baraboo, WI 53913. The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East St., Baraboo, is assisting the family with arrangements.
Take your well-earned angel wings and fly. Until we meet again, may you enjoy the comfort of God’s grace and love.

Max Wilhelm Herrmann Sr., 98, of Middleton, formerly of Baraboo, passed away peacefully on Friday, March 6, 2015 at Heritage Senior Assisted Living in Middleton.
Max was born June 14, 1916 in Beloit, the son of Max Bernard and Ada Mae (Jenks) Herrmann. He graduated from Wauwatosa East High School and attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he was the yearbook editor in 1939.
He enlisted in the Army Air Corps during WWII and was trained as a bombardier in a B-17 and served from 1941-1945, attaining the rank of First Lieutenant.  On October 10, 1942 he married the love of his life, Ruth Louise Hampel in Topeka, Kan.  After his honorable discharge from the service, they lived in Milwaukee, Elkhorn, Roseville, Minn., Hales Corners and finally, Baraboo. During the winter months of their retirement years, they traveled to their home in Venice, Fla.
While living in Hales Corners, Max served on the Whitnall Area School Board and PTA when Whitnall High School was first built, and was also a founder and Deacon at Heritage Presbyterian Church.  After working for several years in business management, he bought W.C. Heath and Associates, a well-respected consulting firm with offices on the top floor of the Milwaukee Gas Building, at that time the tallest building in the city. He later sold that business and moved to Baraboo to manage and then own Humane Equipment Company.  During his time there, Max traveled to Germany and secured the technology and licensing to use recycled tires to manufacture cow mats and other related products and the company grew substantially.  He served on the Sauk County Development Board and the Baraboo Community Development Association.  In addition, Max and Ruth were members of the First Presbyterian Church.
Max worked hard to provide a wonderful life for his family.  He enjoyed spending time with his wife and two sons and especially the family vacations up North, out West to the Rocky Mountains and other areas.  His other outside interests included gardening, yard work and having the best looking lawn and rose bushes in the neighborhood.
While in Florida, Max and Ruth took up square and ballroom dancing and enjoyed beachcombing and swimming in their pool.  They belonged to several bridge clubs over the years and always looked forward to a good game. Golf was Max’s favorite activity and to say he was an avid golfer would be an understatement. Max lived a full and abundant life, enjoying his many friends and family.  His mind was sharp and his health was good until he passed, so he endured little pain or suffering.

Marian Emma Getsinger, 98, of Baraboo, passed away Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2015, with her family members at her bedside at Oak Park Place.
Marian was born in Pittsville, March 23, 1916 to Verne and Elsa McCoy. She attended grade and high school in Pittsville, later attended a two-year county college in Wisconsin Rapids. Later in her teaching career, she received a bachelor’s degree in upper elementary education from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point.
Marian taught for 23 years in Wisconsin public schools, serving her last 17 in Baraboo, where she taught middle school math. Many of her students still living in the community remember her as a tough but fair educator. She met her husband, Henry Getsinger, while teaching in Cranmoor. They married in Crown Point, Ind., in October 1937.
While Henry served in the Pacific during World War II, Marian moved to Wautoma to live with her parents and sister until her husband returned. The couple moved to Baraboo in 1948, where they raised two children, Stephen and Sandra.
A devoted neighbor, Marian could often be found delivering a homemade pie, bread or cookies to a friend in need. She was a longtime member of First United Methodist Church, although illness recently made it impossible for her to attend services.
An avid reader, Marian was fascinated by history and sought to understand the deep-rooted connections driving the world around her. She was a cutthroat Scrabble player with a vibrant vocabulary.   
A declining mental status made some aspects of her life very difficult in her last years, but Marian’s deep faith remained a source of comfort and strength, even to her last days. Though sassy at times, Marian’s greatest gift was her ability to see the goodness inside each person. She will be deeply missed by those who loved her.
Marian was preceded in death by her husband of 30 years, Henry; and her sisters, Helen Danielson and Eileen Dilts. 
She is survived by her son, Stephen (Ruth) Getsinger, of Baraboo; a daughter, Sandra (Robert) Pizzola, of Lafayette, Ind.; grandchildren, Annie and Elizabeth Getsinger, Katie (Chad) Albertson, Matthew and David Pizzola; and three great-grandchildren.
A celebration of life service will be held at 10 a.m. on Saturday, April 25, 2015 at the First United Methodist Church, 615 Broadway St., Baraboo, with Pastor Marianne Cotter officiating. Visitation will be from 9:30 a.m. until time of service. Private inurnment will be held in Forest Hill Cemetery, Wisconsin Rapids.

Her family would like to extend a sincere thank you to the dedicated staff of Oak Park Place’s Autumn Lane memory unit, Drs. James R. Damos and Stuart G. Hannah, and Agrace Hospice for the kind, compassionate care shown to Marian. The Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home is assisting the family with arrangements.

Joseph “Joe” Wisinger, 83, of Baraboo, passed away on Sunday, June 1, 2014 at Maplewood of Sauk City Nursing Home.
Joe was born on March 3, 1931 in Sendehely, Hungary, the son of Jakob and Maria (German) Wirschinger. In 1946, at the age of 14 he went to Germany to seek work as a farm hand and coal miner. While there, he met Fannie Forster and they were married in 1951.  
Their first daughter Angie was born, and in 1952 they immigrated to the United States. They were graciously sponsored by a Wisconsin farm family near Rice Lake and while there, Joe learned farming and daughter Carol was born.
Later, Joe moved the family to Lead, S.D., and in 1954, he enlisted in the United States Army as part of an artillery unit during the Korean War. Afterwards, Joe joined the National Guard unit and was also employed by the Homestake Gold Mining Corporation, working deep underground. Then, Laura, Roger and Steve were born and Joe enjoyed taking the whole family on numerous hunting and fishing excursions.
In 1967, Joe brought the family to North Freedom, and he worked for several area companies including the Badger Army Ordinance Ammunitions Plant where he was in production for many years. After production stopped, Joe stayed on and worked in maintenance learning the painting trade and became a union painter.

He also travelled the United States working on a variety of projects ranging from a nuclear power facility in Texas to a road side motel in California.
In retirement, Joe could not take the harsh Wisconsin winters so he decided to settle in Paradise, Calif., where he could indulge in a unique gold panning hobby. In 2009, he came back to Wisconsin and lived his remaining years in comfort, near his family, and believing his time to meet the lord would come soon. That day came last Sunday morning when he passed in peace to meet the Lord.

Maureen Teelin of Baraboo, passed away suddenly on Monday Feb. 3, 2014 due to a brain aneurism. She is with her God and those she loved who passed before her.
Maureen was a graduate from Baraboo schools and earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in archeology and geography at U.W. La Crosse. 
Many lives were touched by Maureen in so many ways. Caring, loving and kind are just a few words that describe the very heart and soul of her. Even in death she was “giving.” Maureen was an organ donor so others may live.
She is survived by her parents, Terry and Una Teelin; her brother, Tom (Joy) Teelin; sisters, Kelly Teelin and Laura (Doug) Baragar; her companion, Matthew Gumz; and many aunts, uncles, numerous cousins (here in the USA and Ireland), and her many dear friends. She will be sorely missed. 
She was preceded in death by her maternal and paternal grandparents.
Private family services will be held at the Rago-Baldwin Funeral Home, 520 East St., in Baraboo.
In lieu of flowers, donations in Maureen’s memory may be made to the UW Health Transplant or Organ Donation program at UW Health.org. 
May God hold you in the palm of his hand until we meet again!
